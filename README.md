Heart Disease Prediction
Introduction
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. By leveraging clinical data, we build predictive models that assist in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease. The project uses modern tools and frameworks to ensure robust, interpretable, and accurate predictions.

Objectives
Develop a predictive system for heart disease detection.
Analyze and preprocess clinical data for model training.
Compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms to find the best model.
Provide an intuitive and interactive interface for users to input data and get predictions.
